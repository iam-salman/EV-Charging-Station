# Wireless EV Charging Station

## Overview
This project aims to design and simulate a MATLAB-based model for a wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging station. The primary focus is on reducing the strain on the grid while ensuring efficient battery charging.

## Features
1. **EV Charging Station Model**: We have developed a typical model for an EV charging station.
2. **PFC Rectifier**: To alleviate the strain on the grid, we have implemented a Power Factor Correction (PFC) rectifier.
3. **Efficient Battery Charging**: Our ongoing work involves integrating a buck converter to achieve efficient battery charging.

## Usage
To run the simulation:
1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Open the .slx file in MATLAB.
3. Navigate to the simulation settings and configure the parameters as needed.
4. Run the simulation.
